## Features

airSlate offers many useful features that help businesses save time and avoid mistakes by automating common tasks. Here are some of its main features:

**1. Workflow Automation**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/airslate">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NCtLghnAXTiQgupdPmhkhm3j3ypk1YGY" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

airSlate lets you create workflows that automate a series of tasks without any coding. For example, you can set up a workflow where once a form is submitted, it automatically sends an approval request to a manager, then routes the signed document to your storage system. This cuts down on manual work and helps keep things moving smoothly without delays.

**2. E-Signatures**

</a>

You can send documents for electronic signatures right within airSlate. These e-signatures are legally binding and meet global standards like ESIGN and eIDAS. This means you don’t have to print, sign, scan, or fax papers anymore. People can sign contracts or agreements online, which speeds up the process and makes it easier to track.

**3. Document Generation**

</a>

With document generation, airSlate helps you create documents automatically from templates. Instead of typing the same information repeatedly, you can set up templates where data from forms or other sources fills in the blanks. This is great for creating contracts, invoices, or reports quickly and with fewer mistakes.

**4. Custom Forms**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/airslate">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RYKBqzSOK574hwHyumQoDoDNn0FASvh5" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

airSlate allows you to build custom forms that people can fill out online. These forms can collect any kind of data—customer information, order details, employee requests, and more. Once someone submits a form, airSlate can trigger the next steps in your workflow automatically, so nothing gets missed.

**5. App Integrations**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/airslate">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FRU8HWH-ZmvNih32buRfzWbP9jWHIp4V" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

airSlate works with many popular apps like Salesforce, Google Workspace, Slack, Dropbox, and Microsoft 365. These integrations mean you can connect your workflows with the tools you already use. For example, when a contract is signed, airSlate can automatically update your Salesforce records or send a notification to your Slack channel.

**6. Analytics and Reporting**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/airslate">

</a>

The platform provides clear reports and dashboards that show how your workflows are performing. You can see how many tasks are completed, how long things take, and where delays happen. This helps you understand your process better and find ways to make it more efficient.

**7. Collaboration Tools**

airSlate makes it easy to share documents and workflows with your team or external partners. You can control who can view, edit, or approve documents. This keeps everyone on the same page and makes teamwork smoother.

These features work together to remove repetitive manual work, reduce errors, and help your team get more done in less time.
